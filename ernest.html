       <h2><strong>List of my projects</strong></h2>
        <p>since i joined Moringa school, i've been able to learn and 
            gain alot and to enhance that i had to practise alot and here is 
            a list of projects that i was able to establish and commit changes
             to make them look presentable;
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Ern-est/Hybrid.git"> lms</a></li>
        This project contains all about moringa school i.e services offered by school,
        its location,its vision and mission,an image of a classroom where lectures take 
        place and a link to its own website for more information.This all has been enhanced
         by use of tags such as image tag,paragraph 
        tag,strong tag and the anchor tag which provides a link to the school website.
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Ern-est/Hybrid.git"> webpage</a></li>
        This project entails all activities that take place in moringa school,skills gained by students while 
        at moringa school,life after moringa school and responsibilities of moringa alumnis.All these have been brought about by the use of tags such as;ordered list tags,unordered list tags,paragraph tags and a footer tag.
